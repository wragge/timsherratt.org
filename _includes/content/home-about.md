I've worked across the cultural heritage sector and have been developing online resources relating to libraries, archives, museums and history since 1993.

My tools and experiments include important things like [The Real Face of White Australia](http://invisibleaustralians.org/faces/), useful things like [QueryPic](http://dhistory.org/querypic/), and weird things like the [Vintage Face Depot](https://wragge.github.io/face-depot/).

I'm currently [Associate Professor of Digital Heritage](http://www.canberra.edu.au/about-uc/faculties/arts-design/courses/undergraduate/heritage-museums-conservation/tabs/staff/heritage-staff/sherratt,-tim) at the University of Canberra.
